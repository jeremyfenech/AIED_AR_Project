# AIED AR Project

An application, developped for Artificial Intelligence in Education (ARI2131), using Unity and AR foundation to create a face tracking Augmented Reality application.

The app tracks a user's head and displays a UI over it showing questions related to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

A custom script was written to detect the tilt of a user's head and uses this input to choose whether the user wants to pick the right or the left question.

After 15 randomly selected questions the user is shown the final score.
